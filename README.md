# MakotoFM

This project is a Radio station that only purpose if to test things, and learn how radio works. 
This project requires the back-end to work that can be found at [Asthriona/MakotoFM-back](https://github.com/Asthriona/MakotoFM-back)  
You may use this project for your own, but please change the logos and styles. 
Also, you should know that it's a "side project" I work on it whenever I feel like it or have ideas to implement/improve it. 
Do not expect too much from this, my radio days are long gone now. And while I still have it as a hobby, my main projects and goals are much more important to me than this one.
