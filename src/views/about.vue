            Formerly known as Cloudsdale Group, we've come a long way from our
            humble beginnings as Cloudsdale Radio in 2013. With time,
            dedication, and a passion for great broadcasting, we've evolved into
            a dynamic network that continues to captivate audiences around the
            world.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left mt-4 mb-4">
            In 2014, Cloudsdale Group was born, expanding our horizons to
            encompass not one but four distinct stations: Cloudsdale Radio,
            Cloudsdale Radio Wonderbolt, and Cloudsdale Radio Electro Swing. Our
            journey took an unexpected turn in January 2018 when the decision
            was made to sell the network. That's when our story intersects with
            a remarkable twist.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left mt-4 mb-4">
            Enter Makoto Kobayashi, one of our dedicated employees who saw the
            potential in what we had built. Determined to breathe new life into
            the network, Makoto Kobayashi stepped in as the new owner and
            introduced a fresh addition to our lineup, "AnimeFM." While the
            enthusiasm was high, the financial challenges proved daunting, and
            we temporarily ceased broadcasting on January 1, 2019.

            Fast forward to 2023, and Sora Media Network emerges from the ashes
            with renewed energy and vigor. Under the capable leadership of
            Makoto Kobayashi, Mio Shimizu, and Kyoko Takahashi, we've embarked
            on a new chapter of our journey. Our headquarters have found a new
            home in Japan, and we now oversee operations across two countries.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left mt-4 mb-4">
            Currently, we proudly broadcast from two exceptional stations:
            "Cloudsdale Radio" and "MakotoFM," with exciting plans to
            reintroduce "AnimeFM" on the horizon. We've assembled a team of
            talented developers and managers who are working diligently to craft
            our own players, broadcasting systems, and relays. As we continue to
            innovate and grow, our commitment to delivering top-notch
            entertainment remains unwavering.
