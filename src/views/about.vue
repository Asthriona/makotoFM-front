              Formerly known as Cloudsdale Group, we've come a long way from our
              humble beginnings as Cloudsdale Radio in 2013. With time,
              dedication, and a passion for great broadcasting, we've evolved into
              a dynamic network that continues to captivate audiences around the
              world.

              In 2014, Cloudsdale Group was born, expanding our horizons to
              encompass not one but four distinct stations: Cloudsdale Radio,
              Cloudsdale Radio Wonderbolt (Station dedicated to rock), and Cloudsdale Radio Electro Swing. Our
              journey took an unexpected turn in January 2018 when the decision
              was made to sell the network. That's when our story intersects with
              a remarkable twist.

              The new owner, a visionary in their own right, recognized the
              potential of our network and took it to new heights. However, as
              time passed, the network faced challenges that led to its
              unfortunate demise. The once-thriving stations fell silent, and the
              vibrant community we had built began to fade away. It was a
              heartbreaking moment for all of us who had poured our hearts and
              souls into this endeavor. The network that had once been a beacon of
              creativity and connection was now a distant memory.

              Fast forward to 2023, and Sora Media Network emerges from the ashes
              with renewed energy and vigor. Under the capable leadership of
              Makoto Kobayashi, Mio Shimizu, and Kyoko Takahashi, we've embarked
              on a new chapter of our journey. Our headquarters have found a new
              home in Japan, and we now oversee operations across two countries.

            <p class="text-left mt-4 mb-4">
              Currently, we proudly broadcast from two exceptional stations:
              "Cloudsdale Radio" and "MakotoFM," with exciting plans to
              reintroduce "AnimeFM" on the horizon. We've assembled a team of
              talented developers and managers who are working diligently to craft
              our own players, broadcasting systems, and relays. As we continue to
              innovate and grow, our commitment to delivering top-notch
              entertainment remains unwavering.

            For short Makoto FM has started as a Joke, and grew internally as out "lab".
            It serves as a platform where we experiment with new technologies, test innovative ideas, and refine our
            broadcasting systems. Over time, it has evolved into a unique station that blends personal taste with
            cutting-edge advancements, making it a cornerstone of our research and development efforts.
